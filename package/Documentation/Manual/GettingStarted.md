# Getting Started

Foundry docgen uses a combination of docfx and editor ui to help create documentation for a Unity Package

## Prerequisites

Install DocFx using the instructions here: https://dotnet.github.io/docfx/tutorial/docfx_getting_started.html

## Setup

To set up a Package to use Foundry Docgen, open Foundry > Documentation > Docgen Helper from the main menu, this will 
show you a list of every local package you have installed. If you have not set up that package to work with our docgen 
system yet you'll be presented with some options and a button to create the necessary files. Once done you can then 
press the Generate Docs button to generate docs, and Preview Docs to preview them.
